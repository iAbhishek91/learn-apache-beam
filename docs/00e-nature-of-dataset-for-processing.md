# Data

Here we describe about data from **processing point of view**.

## bounded Data

- Bounded data is fixed: *e.g: fixed amount of data*
- Sitting on  storage *probably in a blob storage like S3 or GCS or a file*

## unbounded Data

- Unbounded data are infinite
- Constantly changing.
- flow of incoming data. *also known as streaming data*
- common source: pub/sub, queue, sockets, stream APIs.
